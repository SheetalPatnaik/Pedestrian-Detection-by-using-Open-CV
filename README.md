# 🚶‍♂️ Pedestrian Detection using OpenCV

## 📝 About This Project
This project implements **real-time pedestrian detection** using **OpenCV and computer vision techniques**. It leverages **HOG (Histogram of Oriented Gradients) and Haar cascades** to detect pedestrians in images and video streams, making it useful for applications like **autonomous vehicles, surveillance, and smart traffic systems**.  

## 🌟 Features
✅ **Real-time pedestrian detection** in images and videos  
✅ **Uses OpenCV's pre-trained models (HOG + SVM, Haar cascades)**  
✅ **Frame-by-frame detection for dynamic environments**  
✅ **Optimized for accuracy and performance**  
✅ **Easy to integrate into security and surveillance systems**  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Programming Language**: Python  
- **Computer Vision Library**: OpenCV  
- **Machine Learning Models**: HOG + SVM, Haar cascades  
- **Visualization**: Matplotlib (for image display)
